I consider myself a technical guy who is taking time to grow skills in IT, Coding, Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing.  I enjoy learning coding primarily in Python for purposes of data analytics, analytics and game design.  I also have been learning GML from Game Maker.  I commonly partake in training opportunites and webinars for cybersecurity to network and learn new relevant skills. I also love to partake in home projects commonly using VMs to simulate a multitude of It and Cybersecurity fundamentals. 

## Objective

My journey in IT has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am pursuing a position as a SOC Analyst with strong knowledge of blue team and red team principals.
